    "### Peer review team\n",
    "\n",
    "- Peer review by: Group B\n",
    "- Names of team members that participated in this review: Niels-Janos Simmet & Raghid Allaham\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal of the project\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Predict if two peopol of opposite sex are having a \"match\" based on certin attributes.\n",
    "2) Find out what are the most importent attributes to get a match in opposite sex speed dating.\n",
    "3) Proof of correctness of the following hypotheses:\n",
    "-   Survey participants who both have the specific characteristics samerace and opposite gender tend to achieve more matches\n",
    "-   Survey participants with a higher income tend to achieve more matches than survey participants with a lower income\n",
    "-   Achieving matches because of having the same specific characteristics occur in both sexes\n",
    "-   Three weeks after the event, males called women more often\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Fisman et al. conducted a survey regarding speed dating habits and collected 8,000 observations.\n",
    "These data were collected from participants in experimental speed dating events held in 2002-2004. In these events, participants had a four-minute \"first date\" with each other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of the four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on some characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data: https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/eagan/class/igr204/datasets/SpeedDating.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Description is good\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis (TODO)\n",
    "- Why is the Descriptiv statistics done on the Train Data Set? Is this on purpose?\n",
    "- Gender differences per Attribute is not displaying any output for me. I think because you are setting the Graph as c1 but never call it again\n",
    "- Attribute importance to get a match Graph: Here I would prefer to size the circles relative instead of absolute, as there is a big difference between match/no match that disorts the graphic.\n",
    "- I would do Exploratory Data Analysis before the descriptive statistics and not only use the train data\n",
    "- Attribute correlation graph is hard to interprete due to the graphics, maybe you could rather use a heat map of some sort instead to make it clearer?\n",
    "- Correlation Table: use a different gradient to also highlight strong negative correlations. With that gradient high positiv is blue and high negative is white even though the absolutes matter.\n",
    "- I don't see the point in using a synthetically balanced data set. You are no longer refering to actual data that was gathered but a hypothetical study.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion.\n",
    "- You state that there is a negative correlation for being the same gender. Where did you show that? Whern't all the pairing heterosexual?\n",
    "- Could you do types like Athletes, Religious persons, ... or is the data not sufficient for that?\n",
    "- Why didn't you investigate 2 of 4 Hypotheses. What is the point in setting these if you don't investigate. Was there not enough data? Please elaborate.\n",
    "- Three weeks after the event males called women more often. Can you do a significants test here i.e. Students T Test? With what confidence can you say that. Especially regarding the percentage of NaN values for that question.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lack of clarity\n",
    "- An explanation of how the data was collected would be helpful.\n",
    "\t- Were the dates randomly assigned? Or was an attempt made to allocate suitable participants on the basis of certain characteristics during the allocation process?\n",
    "\t- Did only heterosexuals participate in the study? If the proportion of homosexuals is higher in one gender, there could be a bias in exclusively heterosexual pairings during SpeedDating.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does one observation equal the answers from one person regarding one date or the answer of both persons regarding one date or a summary of the whole event from one persons perspective? \n",
    "- Depending on that I don't see how adding the calls makes sense\n",
    "- The discrepancy between them_call and you_call could be explained by the fact that not all participants answered the question. As half of the subjects didn't answer that question. Interesting would be, if both sexes didn't answer that question to the same percentage or if i.e. mostly women didn't answer that question.\n",
    "\n",
    "- No clear definition, what does \"mach\" mean?  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The main question task could be clearer (prediction of \"mach\" depending on some attributes).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible improvements\n",
    "- In the introduction talked about \"willingness to date has decreased, dating is too expensive and time consuming...\" here would be a source quite nice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In addition, you could have separated the data by gender to see how differently genders react to characteristics. (example hypothesis: men don't like it when a woman is ambitious.) plot a correlation matrix per gender and examine which attributes are most important to a woman and which attributes are important to a man. Doing so would answer the research question: \"Do these specific characteristics occur in both sexes?\". \n",
    "\n",
    "- You should show the original data set with its original characteristics so the reader can understand why you chose your subset of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You could try including more / other variables in your models and see if the performance changes. This could lead to a different conclusion, or you could use backward or forward selection to select the variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "- The most interesting part is how to answer the research question.\n",
    " Is something similar already being used by dating apps? If so, what kind of data are they using?\n",
    " \n",
    "- And what could be done to further improve the models to compare the two. What could be the next steps for a follow up project.\n",
