    "### Peer review team\n",
    "\n",
    "- Peer review by: Group B\n",
    "- Names of team members that participated in this review: Niels-Janos Simmet & Raghid Allaham\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal of the project\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Predict if two peopol of opposite sex are having a \"match\" based on certin attributes.\n",
    "2) Find out what are the most importent attributes to get a match in opposite sex speed dating.\n",
    "3) Proof of correctness of the following hypotheses:\n",
    "-   Survey participants who both have the specific characteristics samerace and opposite gender tend to achieve more matches\n",
    "-   Survey participants with a higher income tend to achieve more matches than survey participants with a lower income\n",
    "-   Achieving matches because of having the same specific characteristics occur in both sexes\n",
    "-   Three weeks after the event, males called women more often\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Fisman et al. conducted a survey regarding speed dating habits and collected 8,000 observations.\n",
    "These data were collected from participants in experimental speed dating events held in 2002-2004. In these events, participants had a four-minute \"first date\" with each other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of the four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on some characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data: https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/eagan/class/igr204/datasets/SpeedDating.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach, tools and methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data is imported and corrected.\n",
    " A subset of the data is made by only selecting variables that are known before a play. \n",
    " The variables are explained within a data dictionary, and some data exploration is made.\n",
    " The relation and correlation from the subset with the response variable is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The tools used are well known data manipulation and machine learning libraries such as\n",
    "pandas, numpy, altair, matplotlib and sklearn\n",
    "\n",
    "- A pairplot matrix and correlation matrix is made to show relation and correlation of variables.\n",
    " The data is split into training and test set for the models.\n",
    " The regression is modelled by using Linear, Lasso and KNN Regression algorithms.\n",
    " These are then compared to a model that always predicts the mean of yards gained (similar to a naive predictor that sets a baseline).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lack of clarity\n",
    "\n",
    "- No clear deffintion, what does \"mach\" mean?  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The mean question Task could be clearer (Prediction of \"mach\" depenting on some atributs).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "- In addition, you could have separated the data by gender to see how differently genders react to characteristics. (example hypothesis: men don't like it when a woman is ambitious.) plot a correlation matrix per gender and examine which attributes are most important to a woman and which attributes are important to a man. Doing so would answer the research question: \"Do these specific characteristics occur in both sexes?\". \n",
    "\n",
    "- You should show the original dataset with its original features, this way the reader can understand why You chose Your subset of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In your models, you could try to include more / other variables and see if the performance changes. \n",
    " This could lead to a different conclusion or use backward or forward selection to chose the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "- The most interesting part is how the research question can be answered.\n",
    " Is something similar already used by Dating Apps? if yes, what kind of data do they use?\n",
    " \n",
    "- Also what could be done in order to improve the models further, what the next steps for a follow-up project could be.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Organization\n",
    "\n",
    "- The only improvements for code organizations is to consistently use comments for every block of code. \n",
    " Other than that the code is clean and easy to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data is not clearly located within the data folder.\n",
    "The cleaned dataset is found within the raw folder together with the original dataset.\n",
    "Is the data_cleaned_2021.csv the original dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is no model being saved for the Lasso Regression.\n",
    "The linear regression and KNN Regression Model file have the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further comments\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do you have additional content for the appendix?\n",
    " Because there is none in the notebook yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you want to put the icing on the cake for interactive graphs you could use tooltips:\n",
    "alt.Chart(df_tmp).mark_bar().encode(\n",
    "    x=alt.X(\"yards_gained\"),\n",
    "    y=alt.Y('count()'),\n",
    "    tooltip = ['yards_gained']\n",
    ").interactive()"
